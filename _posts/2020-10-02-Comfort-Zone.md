I went boxing today and it was awesome! I bought a 10-time class pack.

I just realized that in the past, I always rely on other people to drag me out of my comfort zone. I rely on my exes to make new friends, I rely on other people's invitations to social events.

Instead of reaching out myself, I was always passively extending my comfort zone. I just realized it is so nice to step out of my comfort zone and meet new people all by myself.
