I’ve been living an irresponsible life until this summer and I’m gradually realizing that I need to actively fight for goals. I am trying my best to rebuild the norm of my lifes. It is a tough process but I am happy that I am realizing it and living the most out of it.

I am direct and I appreciate people being direct to me. If you have any concerns or complaints about the actions I am taking, I am always ready to listen to your comments. Isn’t it much simpler when people just being direct and frank?

I am mildly alcholic. It may sounds like stereotype but I am basically into any alchohol that is sweet (Moscato, Mojito, Ice smirnoff… and any sweet white wine). I am very lightweight and will become tipsy after half a beer :)

I’ve been suffering from some anxiety issue but it’s getting under control gradually.

I really enjoy going to the gym and ngl, but the one hour I spend in gym everyday is usually the happiest hour of my day.

I’m learning German so if you speak German, help me!

And I’m also trying to learn boxing.
