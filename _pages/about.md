I am currently a first year MPhil candidate of HKUST. My program is Data Science and Analytics and my supervisors are [Professor Qiong Luo](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~luo/) from CSE department and [Professor Yi Yang](http://yya518.github.io/) from ISOM department. I graduated from HKUST with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics during summer of 2020. 

Random things about me
======
I've been living an irresponsible life until this summer and I'm gradually realizing that I need to actively fight for goals. I am trying my best to rebuild the norm of my lifes. It is a tough process but I am happy that I am realizing it and living the most out of it.

I am direct and I appreciate people being direct to me. If you have any concerns or complaints about the actions I am taking, I am always ready to listen to your comments. Isn't it much simpler when people just being direct and frank?

I am mildly alcholic. It may sounds like stereotype but I am basically into any alchohol that is sweet (Moscato, Mojito, Ice smirnoff... and any sweet white wine). I am very lightweight and will become tipsy after half a beer :)
